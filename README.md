An exploration of first-person 3D game programming, in Clojure.

In this "game", you can push a large, florescent grid-looking ball around the ground,
or drop a block out of thin air onto the ground and push that around. You can
float and navigate to the top of the ball or block. You can add more blocks.
You can build a tower of blocks and watch them teeter and fall.

## Installation

Install Leinengen first.

## Usage

Start by running: `lein run`

Use the mouse to look up, down, left, right.

Press 'a' to shift (strife) to the left
Press 'd' to shift (strife) to the right

Press 'w' to move forward
Press 's' to move backward

Hold the spacebar to slowly float upwards.
